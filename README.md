# File-Integrity-Using-Linux-Hash-functions
The objective of this task was to verify the integrity of two text files and determine if they were identical or had been altered. I used Linux hashing commands and file comparison tools to generate and analyze SHA-256 checksums for each file.In this project, I used Linux tools to check file integrity. By applying sha256sum and cmp, I demonstrated how hashing can detect even small differences between files. This approach is critical for verifying data integrity, detecting file tampering, and ensuring secure file management.
